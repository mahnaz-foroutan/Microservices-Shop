# Microservices-Shop

See the overall picture of **implementations on microservices with .net tools** on real-world **Microservices-Shop** project;

![microservices_remastered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1147445/110304529-c5b70180-800c-11eb-832b-a2751b5bda76.png)

There is a couple of microservices which implemented **e-commerce** modules over **Catalog, Basket, Discount** and **Ordering** microservices with **NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)** and **Relational databases (PostgreSQL, Sql Server)** with communicating over **RabbitMQ Event Driven Communication** and using **Ocelot API Gateway**.

And here continuation of the main course -> [Microservices Observability with Distributed Logging, Health Monitoring, Resilient and Fault Tolerance with using Polly](https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-observability-resilience-monitoring-on-net/?referralCode=D162C050483C75452136)

* **MongoDB database** connection and containerization
* Repository Pattern Implementation
* Swagger Open API implementation	

#### Basket microservice which includes;
* ASP.NET Web API application
* REST API principles, CRUD operations
* **Redis database** connection and containerization
* Consume Discount **Grpc Service** for inter-service sync communication to calculate product final price
* Publish BasketCheckout Queue with using **MassTransit and RabbitMQ**
  
#### Discount microservice which includes;
* ASP.NET **Grpc Server** application
* Build a Highly Performant **inter-service gRPC Communication** with Basket Microservice
* Exposing Grpc Services with creating **Protobuf messages**
* Using **Dapper for micro-orm implementation** to simplify data access and ensure high performance
* **PostgreSQL database** connection and containerization

#### Microservices Communication
* Sync inter-service **gRPC Communication**
* Async Microservices Communication with **RabbitMQ Message-Broker Service**
* Using **RabbitMQ Publish/Subscribe Topic** Exchange Model
* Using **MassTransit** for abstraction over RabbitMQ Message-Broker system
* Publishing BasketCheckout event queue from Basket microservices and Subscribing this event from Ordering microservices	
* Create **RabbitMQ EventBus.Messages library** and add references Microservices

#### Ordering Microservice
* Implementing **DDD, CQRS, and Clean Architecture** with using Best Practices
* Developing **CQRS with using MediatR, FluentValidation and AutoMapper packages**
* Consuming **RabbitMQ** BasketCheckout event queue with using **MassTransit-RabbitMQ** Configuration
* **SqlServer database** connection and containerization
* Using **Entity Framework Core ORM** and auto migrate to SqlServer when application startup
#### Authentication and Authorization 
* JWT
* OpenIDConnect	

#### API Gateway Ocelot Microservice
* Implement **API Gateways with Ocelot**
* Sample microservices/containers to reroute through the API Gateways
* Run multiple different **API Gateway/BFF** container types	
* The Gateway aggregation pattern in Shopping.Aggregator

#### WebUI ShoppingApp Microservice
* ASP.NET Core Web Application with Bootstrap 5 and Angular 15 template
* Call **Ocelot APIs with HttpClientFactory** and **Polly**
* check authentication
#### Microservices Cross-Cutting Implementations
* Implementing **Centralized Distributed Logging with Elastic Stack (ELK); Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana and SeriLog** for Microservices
* Use the **HealthChecks** feature in back-end ASP.NET microservices
* Using **Watchdog** in separate service that can watch health and load across services, and report health about the microservices by querying with the HealthChecks

#### Microservices Resilience Implementations
* Making Microservices more **resilient Use IHttpClientFactory** to implement resilient HTTP requests
* Implement **Retry and Circuit Breaker patterns** with exponential backoff with IHttpClientFactory and **Polly policies**

#### Ancillary Containers
* Use **Portainer** for Container lightweight management UI which allows you to easily manage your different Docker environments
* **pgAdmin PostgreSQL Tools** feature rich Open Source administration and development platform for PostgreSQL

#### Docker Compose establishment with all microservices on docker;
* Containerization of microservices
* Containerization of databases
* Override Environment variables
#### Azure DevOps
* add Project
* add Task
* CI/CD pipline
* 
## Run The Project
You will need the following tools:
